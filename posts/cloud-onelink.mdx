# [Cloud One Link](https://cloud-one-link.vercel.app)

A Linktree like Web app that allows users to create and deploy a web page that organizes many links onto one page. Most social media platforms only allow users to share only one link in the bio section of their profile. Someone who feels restricted by that limit would find this app useful because this app allows users to organize many links onto a page, therefor turning one link into many.
